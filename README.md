PkModeling is a Slicer4 Extension that provides [pharmacokinetic modeling][1] for dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE MRI).

PkModeling accepts volumetric timecourse data of signal intensities and computes parametric maps using either a two or three
parameter Tofts model. The estimated parameters include

* Ktrans - volume transfer contrast constant between plasma and the extracellular-extravascular space at each voxel
* Ve - fractional volume for extracellular space at each voxel
* fpv - fractional plasma volume at each voxel
* MaxSlope - maximum slope of the of the time sequence at each voxel
* AUC - area under the curve of each voxel, measured from the bolus arrival time to the end of the time interval, normalized by the AUC of the arterial input function (AIF)
* R^2 - goodness of fit value. Since the parametric model is non-linear, R^2 is not strictly bounded by [-1,1]. But larger values still correspond to better fits.

PkModeling can also output a concentration curve view of the original volumetric timecourse as well as the "fitted" concentration curves resulting from the parametric model.

Estimation of the parametric model is controlled through a series of inputs including

* T1 Blood Value
* T1 Tissue Value
* Relaxivity Value
* Hematocrit Value
* AUC Time Interval Value

Furthermore, an arterial input function (AIF) must be specified either by designating a mask corresponding to the voxels on which to base a patient specific estimate of the AIF, or by specifying a population derived AIF curve directly.

Finally, the estimation of the parametric maps can be restricted to a specified mask defining a region of interest.

Acquisition parameters relevent to the parametric model fitting are embedded in the input volumetric timecourse data, either as attributes on a NRRD file or extracted directly from the underlying DICOM structures

* TR Value - repetition time (in milliseconds)
* TE Value - echo time (in milliseconds)
* FA Value - flip angle (in degrees)
* Timestamps for the timecourses (in milliseconds)
